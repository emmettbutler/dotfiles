## Introduction

I wrote this guide to show you my authentic self as it’s relevant to work. I believe that the most effective
collaboration occurs between people who see and are seen, and I want to give you a leg up in seeing me. I hope that
this guide helps us be effective communicators and collaborators.

At work, I identify as a data engineer who cares deeply about his team’s well-being. I have influence within Parse.ly,
and I commit to using that power to make everyone’s work more fulfilling and enjoyable.

## How I view success

As a flawed human, being good at my job means being at peace with not knowing everything, and constantly learning more.
As a manager, being good at my job means being surrounded by happy, motivated people. As a programmer, being good at my
job means using code to make those peoples’ jobs easier and more enjoyable.

Success as a manager as I see it means finding the middle path between the growth goals of a person I manage and the
company’s goals. If the people I manage are learning and growing in ways that feel meaningful to them, and doing it
while helping the organization progress, I think I’m doing a good job at that moment.

## How I communicate

Positive descriptions of my communication style I’ve heard in the past include: meticulous, considerate,
straightforward, patient, respectful, and “good listener”. Critical feedback about my communication I’ve received
includes that it’s cold, detached, inflexible, or passive-aggressive, especially in writing. When my core needs for
control and predictability feel threatened, I struggle to express my fear constructively and it often manifests as
annoyance.

I have a strong preference for asynchronous text-based methods like GitHub comments, P2, and email (in that order). I
don’t like Slack, because it limits my ability to respond empathically and feels unpredictable to me. If I think
there’s any chance that what I write on Slack will be or has been misinterpreted, I want to video call to clear it up
as soon as possible.

I completely disconnect and become inaccessible outside of work hours (14:00 to 23:00 GMT), with the exception of times
that I’m on call. Whether I’m on call or not, the only reliable way to reach me outside of work hours is by assigning
a high-urgency PagerDuty alert to me.

## Things I do that may annoy you

Communicating on Slack or other textual media while amygdala-hijacked usually makes me precise and wordy. People
perceive me at these times as aloof, curt, cold, and haughty. A growth goal of mine is to notice this feeling when it
arises and give myself a five-minute break before engaging.

Sometimes in text I’m not direct enough. I’ll state some facts and then expect the reader to come to the obvious
conclusion, when it would often be more constructive to say the conclusion or actionable takeaway explicitly. This may
be received as though I think the reader isn’t smart enough to see the obvious.

I really like to ask powerful questions and actively listen. I love saying “I don’t know, let’s figure it out together”
about technical and nontechnical subjects.

Often when asked a direct question, I’ll be silent for 30-60 seconds while I consider my response.

If any of these behaviors do annoy you, please tell me and I’ll work to communicate more effectively with you.

## What gains my trust

Give me notice about things you’ll need from me, ideally more than a day in advance.

If you’re feeling a strong emotion that affects your work (positively or negatively), or if you have a social or
technical problem that you can’t solve, tell me about it. I sincerely want to help you, but I’m not a mind-reader.

Respond within a week to asynchronous communication, especially on GitHub. If it takes weeks for you to respond to a
message, my feeling of control over the work that the answer is blocking starts to feel threatened.

## What loses my trust

The BICEPS core needs that most often feel threatened for me are predictability and control. I don’t handle surprises
well, and being interrupted during a period of focus triggers my amygdala response. If the interruption leads to me
perceiving that work that I didn’t have a say in choosing is being added to my plate, my inner response is even more
negative.

## My strengths

* empathic communication
* active listening
* making engineers’ lives better by eliminating toil
* reading code
* teaching myself new things

## My growth areas

I think through problems slowly and methodically, and my recall for technical minutia isn’t great. I have a hard time
keeping tons of state in my head and thinking through complex algorithms.

I’m working on developing my intuition about others’ subjective experiences and perspectives.

I’m very comfortable with saying “I don’t know” about bits of technical knowledge, but less so about decisions that
I’m asked to make as a leader. This often leads me to grasp for kludgy, absolute solutions that are less helpful than
switching into information-gathering mode would be.

I’m working on catching my triggers before I act on them, especially those that push me to respond with annoyance or
defensiveness.

## What I expect from people I manage

### I think people I manage are doing a good job if they are:

* Setting goals that are achievable and slightly outside of their comfort zone
* Frequently making new and different mistakes
* Leaving a very visible trail of notes and artifacts as they work
* Frequently making non-code contributions like Terraform config, monitoring, and documentation about processes and technology
* Balancing self-teaching with an understanding of what they can learn from others
* Trusting me to accept them as they are

### I think people I manage are doing a bad job if they are:

* Doing work that I can’t easily learn about asynchronously
* Making the same mistake multiple times
* Not asking for help when they truly need it
* Not admitting when they don’t know something
* Ignoring non-code contributions or team process

I focus intensely on empathy and continuous learning, probably more than the average manager.

## How I give and receive feedback

I want to be as charitable as possible when giving evaluative feedback. Before deciding it’s necessary, I do a lot of
soul-searching about whether it’s your behavior or my expectation that needs to be fixed. When I do decide it’s
necessary, I pick a moment when it’s immediately applicable and deliver it on the spot. I strive to frame critical
feedback as an observation about your behavior, its impact, and a request. When you get critical feedback from me, you
can expect to get the benefit of the doubt.

I give positive feedback freely, frequently, and publicly. I strive to regularly voice the good feelings I get and
positive outcomes I see from others’ behavior.

I like to receive critical feedback on a video call, because it lets me react authentically and minimizes the potential
for misunderstanding. I’ll take positive feedback in any medium you like! I have a hard time believing that I’m good
enough, and the longer I go without positive external validation, the more miserable I get.

## How I Approach 1:1s

I like to have 1:1 meetings with each team member at least once every two weeks. The purpose of these meetings is to
demonstrate to each team member that they have my attention for whatever they want to use it for. This often includes
raising issues, asking for feedback on recent work, figuring out shared goals, planning career growth, and more.

I reserve 30 minutes a week for each team member, and give them the option to skip whenever they like. It’s important
to me to give my undivided attention to every person every week, if they want it. I also maintain a shared notepad for
each person’s 1:1, and encourage them to create a plan for each meeting.

Early in my 1:1 relationship with a new team member, I like to ask these questions to set the stage for how we’ll work
together and relate to one another.

## How I Think About Software, Framed By Some of My Favorite Books

[The Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/tips/) is my ultimate book on engineering approach. These “tips” from
it are central to how I think about software:

* There Are No Final Decisions
* Use “Tracer Bullets” to Find the Target
* You Can’t Write Perfect Software
* Decoupled Code is Easier to Change
* Requirements Are Learned in a Feedback Loop
* Organize Fully Functional Teams

[Site Reliability Engineering](https://sre.google/sre-book/table-of-contents/) changed the way I think about
operations. As a member and maintainer of a 24/7 on-call rotation, I know that “partial system failure is inevitable”
and design systems and processes accordingly. I abhor rote, repetitive “toil” and want to automate away as much of it
as possible, allowing the team the space to think critically and creatively.

[Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/) is a central source of my understanding of
distributed systems design and the problems that arise when using databases at scale.

[Python Cookbook/Python Distilled](https://www.dabeaz.com/) by David Beazley illustrate how much fun it is to write
Python code. His pragmatic approach to using the language’s strengths to one’s advantage resonates with me.

## Ways to Get Facetime With Me

* DM me on Slack any time between 8 and 3 US/Pacific and tell me you’d like to chat. I’ll make time for you as soon
as possible.
* Schedule time with me using my [Calendly link](https://calendly.com/emmett9001/30min)
* Wait for your weekly 1:1 slot to come around.
* Attend my weekly office hour: a timeslot where I hang out in my Zoom room and chat with whoever joins about whatever
they’d like. It’s first-come, first-serve and I try to make time for everyone who attends.

## Thank you!

I’m not perfect, but I want to communicate effectively with you and help make your work-life better. Please tell me if
you want to talk about anything in this document, or have feedback about my behavior. I appreciate you!
