===================

It is the Incident Commander’s responsibility to oversee the creation of a postmortem for each incident and post it on
the Postmortems Blog. This template is a useful place to start when writing a postmortem. It can be helpful to put
postmortems through a review process similar to pull request reviews. Another person’s input can provide a valuable
perspective and increase the reach of the postmortem to the whole company.

From the Google SRE book’s chapter on postmortems: “The primary goals of writing a postmortem are to ensure that the
incident is documented, that all contributing root cause(s) are well understood, and, especially, that effective
preventive actions are put in place to reduce the likelihood and/or impact of recurrence.”

It’s important that postmortems are blameless and avoid pointing fingers at individuals or teams. Allocating blame
creates a culture of fear that encourages engineers to sweep incidents under the rug.

* Lays out an appropriate action plan, including automation that fixes the alert
