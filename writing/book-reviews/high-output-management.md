High Output Management
======================

This book is agnostic of the domain of one's work, instead focusing on generally applicable management practices and
frameworks. I believe it's a classic because it clearly states a number of fundamental approaches so elemental that they
seem like they should be obvious. From my perspective as someone with an interest in people-management who has dabbled
in its practice, the most interesting section is Part IV, which addresses the management of individuals. Task-relevant
maturity is a core concept in this section, which covers a bunch of common management practices like writing performance
reviews, evaluating compensation, and convincing employees to stay with the organization.

Other key concepts that stick with me after the read:

The leverage of managerial activities and how to measure a manager's output (by the output of their team)

OKRs - almost feels too trivial to be worth a section, but a useful framework

Goal-setting methodology

Creating a competitive environment between employees (possibly out of fashion since the book's publication)

"Dual reporting" - membership by one employee on multiple teams

How to make 1:1 meetings useful

A detailed methodology for decision-making

"Modes of control" - the tools a manager has available to influence employees
