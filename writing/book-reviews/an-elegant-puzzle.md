An Elegant Puzzle
=================

Here's a little writeup I did for Parse.ly's engineering reading list about the book An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of
Engineering Management by Will Larson. We actually read this book together as a team in a "book club" format right
around the time of an in-person retreat (Myrtle Beach 2019). This review was written in December 2019, so
it's a little dated.

This book provided useful thought frameworks for a number of common situations on engineering teams. My main hesitation
in recommending it is that the systemic approaches it describes are not as applicable on a small team like Parsely as
they would be in a larger organization. At a high level, thinking about management in a systemic way is a great way to
get engineers excited about the prospect of leading people, and to make them more effective at it.

Despite many of the systemic approaches being based on the assumption of rapid headcount growth and constant employee
turnover, the book still includes generally-applicable wisdom about many aspects of engineering management, a few of
which are summarized below.

"Straightforward process, consistently applied": a nice summation of a useful mindset for any advocate of change in an
engineering organization. Larson advocates applying the simplest, highest-leverage process first and applying it
repeatedly as a method for facilitating change.

The fact that most outages are caused by deployments is intuitive for
sufficiently experienced engineers, but rarely is it stated so plainly, and its implications examined this
clearly.

Larson's insight that projects only generate value when they finish leads to a process for running fewer,
smaller parallel projects at any given time. This supports the popular approach of rapid iteration.

Larson advocates
training teams not to answer forms of interruption other than the scheduled interruption rotation as a way to reduce the
impact of toil on the team's productivity. This is a problem that the engineering team has felt acutely in the past and
continues to grapple with despite having an established pager rotation.

The distinction between strategy and vision, with
detailed examples of how to put each into writing, is a useful tool for anyone running a project or driving change.
