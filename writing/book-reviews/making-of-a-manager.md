The Making of a Manager
=======================

I recently took a drive across the Willamette River to Powell's City of Books and picked up a copy of Julie Zhuo's book
The Making of a Manager: What to Do When Everyone Looks to You. Here's what I thought of it!

This is the first management book I've read that I actively disliked. I think this says as much about me as it does
about the book itself. Apparently, I've done enough reading and thinking about my approach to management that I've
formed a reasonably strong opinion. I want to be very careful not to let that strong opinion turn into a set of blinders
that keep me from letting in new ideas. I also want to avoid writing off an entire complex body of ideas based on
a one-line impression - there are still great learnings to take from this book.

My favorite books on management have put a strong focus on people's humanity over results or "productivity" (Resilient
Management is a good example). This resonates deeply with my motivation to do management. I want to create an island of
sanity for the people I work with, keeping the uncertainty and exploitation of our late-capitalist reality at bay and
empowering people to do work that is meaningful to them.

By contrast to this worldview, The Making of a Manager is rooted in the heady venture-capitalist mindset of infinite
growth. This makes sense given that Julie Zhuo worked at Facebook for years, experiencing firsthand some of the most
explosive "hypergrowth" that the tech industry has ever seen. This mindset leads to some recommendations in the book
around performance management and hiring/firing that feel callous to me. There are also numerous reverent anecdotes
about Mark Zuckerberg and a pervasive Silicon Valley bias that I'm not really here for. I can see these aspects being
interesting to someone who's looking for the inside story from Facebook's early days, but that's decidedly not me at
this moment.

Let's not overfocus on the stuff I didn't like. Julie Zhuo is an experienced and successful leader, and her book has
a lot to teach me. Here are a bunch of tidbits that I'm taking with me as I learn more about being a manager.

"Survival mode" - Zhuo acknowledges that if your organization is "on fire", "all bets are off" and as a manager you
should do whatever it takes to survive. This makes perfect sense intuitively and it's something I've never seen
acknowledged in a book before.

Mentoring doesn't need to be formal - I've often heard folks say when asked whether they do mentoring that their company
has no official process for it, so they don't do it. I think that's a shame, because mentoring is something that is at
its best when it's organic. This book includes a section I really enjoyed about how to cultivate and encourage organic
mentorship on a growing team.

The "post-it notes" meeting opener - Start a meeting by having everyone take ten silent minutes to read the prep
materials together and write down their thoughts and questions on a notepad. Then, go around the room letting each
person share their notes. This helps create an environment where all voices are heard, as well as focusing the
conversation and making sure that everyone involved has the relevant context. I really want to try this out the next
time the +parselyengineering guild does a deep dive into a subsystem.

How to ask for feedback - When asking for feedback, Zhuo recommends being specific and leading with the suspected issue.
For example, instead of "How do you think my presentation went", one might say "I'm working on making sure my point is
clear in the first three minutes. Did that come across? How can I make it clearer next time?" The former is likely to
get a response like "It went well", while the latter signals that it's ok to be critical.

Aim to put yourself out of a job - Document process for everything you do that you'll someday want someone to take over.
This is something I already focus pretty heavily on, but this book drove home just how important it is on a growing
team. It prompted me to do this.

Anyone can get better - Zhuo's "growth mindset" says that "anyone can get better at anything given will, hard work, and
time". I absolutely love this - I want to apply it myself, and teach it to everyone around me.

New manager archetypes - "Apprentice", "Pioneer", "New Boss", and "Successor": four different ways to get started in
management, and four different sets of challenges. My personal experience was mostly Apprentice to @kbourgoin with
a little bit of Successor thrown in. The value I got out of this section points to what I think is the book's strongest
suit. Zhuo foregrounds her experience as a new manager struggling to figure out how it all works. I found it deeply
relatable and appreciated the vulnerability.

Fail of the week - This is the idea of normalizing failure as a learning tool by keeping a company-public log of
personal failures. If you know me well, it may not surprise you that I'm very interested in trying this out for myself.

So despite all of these awesome takeaways, I don't highly recommend The Making of a Manager. There's a lot of good stuff
in there, but the bias toward Valley culture and "hypergrowth" put it far down on my favorites list.
