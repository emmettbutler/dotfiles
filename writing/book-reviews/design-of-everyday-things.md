The Design of Everyday Things
=============================

This book is not just for people who work as designers, it is for anyone involved in the creation of products. At
Parse.ly, the entire product team, including ProdEng, DevOps, and ProdStrat, would benefit from reading this book. It
examines objects that we all interact with in daily life to provide a framework for "human-centered design", a product
design method that keeps the end-user in focus at all times. This has implications for the officially-titled Designers
at Parse.ly who decide the look and feel of products. Its lessons can also be applied to the design of the CLI of an
internal tool by a ProdEng team member.

These concepts are especially relevant to Parse.ly and are worth at least cherrypicking:

Chapter 5 discusses the concept of human error, and how it's almost always actually design error. This is especially
enlightening in the context provided by the incidnt response methodology from the Google SRE books.

The "swiss cheese metaphor" of root cause

Chapter 6 describes something similar to "Product-Minded Engineering"

Cross-functional teams are described as the way to make well-designed productse
