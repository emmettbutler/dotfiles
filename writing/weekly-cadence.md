Weekly Cadence
==============

Meeting-Free Monday
-------------------

Mondays should be entirely focused on current project work. This work is ideally asynchronous, or at least with very
minimal interruptions. Scheduled meetings should be about doing project work together, if they are used at all.

Hangout Tuesday
---------------

The team hangs out in Zoom for an hour on Tuesdays.

Description: A loosely-structured participatory environment aimed at continuous learning, sharing, and feedback,
“MC-ed” by the week’s primary on-call

Goals: provide a space to

* learn from each others’ experience and knowledge
* raise technical or process issues that are not covered by the iteration
* disseminate important organizational context between team members

Guidelines and suggestions for the MC:

* Solicit discussion topics ahead oftime in Slack. Here’s an example message: “hey folks! take a moment and consider
    before our hangout today whether there’s anything you’d like to share/learn/present/explore with the group!“
* Guide a feedback session on an in-progress project, similar to a production readiness review.
* Guide a group learning session: pick a subsystem of the backend and screenshare as you explore the code and
    semantics of that subsystem. This shows the group that it’s ok not to know everything, and demonstrates the
    skill of self-teaching.
* Pick a team process that’s been in use for a while and ask the group “do we still need to be doing this? is there a
    better way to accomplish the same goals?“
* Find a recent organizational change or situation that might be confusing and ask someone to describe their
    understanding of it. Discuss with the group how your understanding differs, and try to reach consensus
* Screenshare the reactive queue and look through confusing tickets with the group, asking for help as you go
* Ask each group member in turn for a “whole-person checkin” where they share what’s going on in their life
* Facilitate a postmortem of the previous week’s hangout: “How was last week? What went well? What didn’t go well?
    Anything you’d like to celebrate? Anything you’d like to discuss later in the meeting with team in greater detail?“

Guidelines and suggestions for participants:

* Don’t be afraid to speak up. If someone is hogging the floor, you might say something like “I appreciate your input.
    I wonder if <person x> has any opinion on this – they haven’t said much yet.“
* Consider ahead of time what you’d like the hangout to be like. If you have something you’ve been wanting to learn
    more about or some creation you’d like to demonstrate, bring it up in the hangout.
* Show and tell an in-progress project and ask for feedback.
* Take stock of how the team is functioning: are we adhering to processes that don’t make sense anymore? Are we doing
    too much toil? Are we moving too slowly? Bring up these issues in the hangout!
* Bring a non-company-related lightning talk about a technical topic that you’re excited about
* Pick a “pipe dream” technical project you’d love to work on and tell the group why it could be worth doing. Ask for
    feedback.
* Offer to share ideas like the ones in the above list with the group

Timeline: usually a full hour, sometimes ends early

Bugday Wednesday
----------------

Wednesdays are set aside to work on reactive tasks that come up during the rest of the week. These include technical
debt raised from the team itself, and tickets stemming from customer issues.
