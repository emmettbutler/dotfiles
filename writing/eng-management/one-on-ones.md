One-on-Ones
===========

As the team lead, I like to have 1:1 meetings with each team member at least once every two weeks. The purpose of
these meetings is to demonstrate to each team member that they have their lead’s attention for whatever they want to
use it for. This often includes raising issues, asking for feedback on recent work, figuring out shared goals, and more.

Questions for our first 1:1
---------------------------

We sometimes like to ask the following questions in the first 1:1 with a new member. They’re taken from Lara Hogan’s
blog.

* What makes you grumpy?
* How will I know when you’re grumpy?
* How can I help you when you’re grumpy?
* How do you like feedback – the medium (IRC, email, in person, etc.)
* How do you like feedback – routine like in 1:1s, or as-it-happens?
* How do you prefer to receive recognition? (public or private)
* What makes 1:1s the most valuable for you?
* What are your goals for this year? And fr the next 3 months?
* What do you need from your manager?
* From your team?
* From your peers outside the team?
* Human learning and growth requires the right amount of four things: new challenges, low ego, space to reflect and
    brainstorm, and timely and clear feedback. How are these four going for you? Is there one you need more or less of?
* What’s your favorite way to give yourself a present?
