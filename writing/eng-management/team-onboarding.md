Team Onboarding
===============

Welcome to the team! Now it’s time to dig deeper into what you need to know to be successful member of our team.
First, let’s zoom out and take a look at how we define success. After your first few months at the company,

* You will play a key role in upholding the reliability and maintainability of our data system
* You will create prototypes and features at the right fidelity to test any unknowns.
* You will structure your work in a way that allows you to fail fast so we can quickly adjust.
* You will communicate failures, successes, and the unexpected quickly and clearly.
* You will proficiently use our tools of engineering and communication.
* You will confidently and comfortably make code changes and ship them to production.
* You will make our system more pleasant to work with.
* You will join the on-call and release rotations.

If you think it’s a big jump to go from where you are right now to the above, that is OK! You’re new here and we are
going to help you navigate it all. Below I’ll highlight some of the ways we are going to help you get up and running,
but beyond these docs it’s important to remember that you have a team here that wants to help you succeed. If you ever
feel uncertain, confused, or overwhelmed, you should reach out and ask questions.

How we will help you out
------------------------

* We will help you understand how to communicate and what the expectations are around communication and transparency.
* We will help you get your coding environment up and running.
* We will help you learn the codebase.
* We will help you learn how to operate the system.
* We will clearly communicate our expectations, accountabilities, and common practices.

I like to think of the above as a tree that you can explore depth-first or breadth-first or maybe climb up until you
get the view you need; or maybe it’s more like a web that you climb across trying not to get stuck until eventually you
feel at home.

If you’ve made it through all the above and you still have questions, please ask! If we missed something you thought
was important, or if you’re not having the best possible onboarding experience, then let’s work together to fix that.
