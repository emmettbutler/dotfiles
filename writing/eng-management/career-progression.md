Career Progression
==================

On our team, we mark career progression with a well-defined sequence of titles.

A Title is Not a Job
--------------------

First thing’s first: [Titles are Toxic](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/titles-are-toxic/).

Titles on our team provide a career growth path. The realities of the job market make titles necessary, because when
people leave the company, they need to be able to illustrate their transferrable skills.

We do not emphasize titles internally. You will never hear something like, “that project needs another senior
engineer”. We are all individuals doing our best, and we have a unique mix of strengths and weaknesses. These titles
are a tool to help us interact with the job market, not a strictly imposed hierarchy.

Using the generic Software Engineer as a base instead of something more specific decouples title from job and makes
title less central to a person’s role. However, we understand that not everyone will want to put simply “Software
Engineer” on their resume. You can feel comfortable putting something more descriptive of your job, for example
“Senior Infrastructure Engineer”, on your resume and social profiles.

Engineering Titles
------------------

* Software Engineer: This is someone who is relatively new to Parse.ly or early their programming career.
* Senior Software Engineer: A senior engineer is someone who consistently ships code and acts without needing close
    supervision or mentorship. They help others on their team as needed and are competent and comfortable in all
    aspects of their job.
* Staff Software Engineer: A staff engineer is like a senior engineer, but one whose influence guides a whole team on
    technical and non-technical matters.
* Principal Software Engineer: A principal engineer is someone whose influence extends well outside their team.

Engineering Competency Matrix
-----------------------------
To provide more detail and guidance on the above, we created an Engineering Competency Matrix . This matrix can be a
useful guide for conversation with one’s manager and encodes helpful ideas about the kind of team and culture we want
to promote.

The matrix serves three purposes. It says what traits we value as a team and agree are important. It’s a guide for
career and personal growth and what that looks like at our company. Finally, it can be used as a management tool to
evaluate if someone is ready for a title change. Of those uses, the first two are the most important.

The core idea of the competency matrix is that one’s sphere of influence grows as they become more senior. Each row
starts with project-level work, then it extends to the team, then multiple teams, and then the whole company. This
doesn’t mean you have to move into management to advance.

This matrix is not a checklist. Managers are encouraged to use it as they see fit in their regular career-growth
retrospectives. They may want to highlight one or two areas for someone to focus on, or maybe they don’t want to use
it at all. Either way, the cells in this matrix shouldn’t be the core of a retrospective. There is more to a quality
review than pretending a spreadsheet can provide an objective evaluation of someone’s job performance. Such evaluations
are inherently subjective, and trying to be overly precise can cause more trouble than it’s worth.

How do I get a different title?
-------------------------------

A better question is, “what’s the best way for me to grow right now?”

Your manager’s job is to help you answer this question. The engineering matrix may be a useful guide. If you think
you’re meeting a lot of the qualities of a given title, that’s a good place to start when talking about a title change.
If not, your manager can help you figure out how to get there. If you think that the matrix is completely wrong and
should be changed, that’s great too! It’s a good place to start a conversation either way.

Career Retrospectives
---------------------

Once every quarter or two, your manager will prepare a “retrospective” document, and discuss it with you in a 1:1. A
retrospective suggests a few career growth goals for the next quarter and evaluates your progress against previously-set
goals. It also catalogs and celebrates your recent accomplishments.

Retrospective documents and meetings are collaborative and supportive. They are not the place to give unexpected
critical feedback. The goal is to have conversations about personal career growth regularly.
