• visible work means you don't have to give status updates
• anyone who wants to know your work's status can find it as easily as searching your name on slack
• i've worked for most of my career on a fully distributed team with no central office. nobody knows how much "time in chair" you're spending - the only thing that matters is what you make
• visible work also has the benefit of making status update meetings redundant
• my personal mantra is that nothing i do at work exists if it doesn't create a long-lived, findable artifact
• artifacts are github comments, PR descriptions, branches, shared documentation
• slack is not work artifacts, they expire

ways i make my work visible
• minimize the use of slack DMs
• put slack messages in the most widely-read channel where they apply
• write pull request descriptions that summarize the current state of a project, not just the specific diff proposed
• use links heavily, especially to other pull requests, issues, and documentation
• post daily standup and sitdown messages in slack that contain links to artifacts
• write descriptive and well-linked status updates on team status documents
• when centralized documentation is nonexistent or hard to find, create it and bookmark it in shared slack channels
