How to Help Your Pod Succeed
============================

* Turn your pod into a team
* Find and maintain alignment
* Optimize for fast feedback from real users
* Throw away your prototypes
* Don’t wait for someone else to provide structure - take the lead

So you’re an engineer who got assigned to a pod. You were given a “vision statement”, a “hypothesis”, “success” and
“failure” conditions, and a bunch of teammates. You were asked to prove or disprove the hypothesis in the next
6-12 months. What now?

Gelling
-------

For starters, you and your podmates need to figure out how you’ll work together and develop “fellow feeling”, sympathy
and fellowship resulting from shared feelings and experiences. A software team that has successfully done this is
sometimes called a “gelled team”. 

One way to engender fellow feeling is by setting up a shared ritual. The repetition and predictability give group
members a feeling of safety and belonging that’s a prerequisite for a gelled team. Maybe the ritual is a weekly video
call a daily Slack standup, or something else entirely.

If you’re on a pod, don’t expect someone to do this for you! Start the conversation with your podmates about what
rituals will help you be more connected as a team.

Alignment
---------

Your pod has a hypothesis. Everything you do as a member of the pod should be in service of proving or disproving
(also known as validating) the hypothesis. Crucially, this includes deciding how to spend your focus time. What can you
spend the next iteration building that will make the biggest step toward validating the hypothesis? Do we all know
exactly what that hypothesis is and means? Everyone on the pod needs to be constantly asking themselves, and each other,
these questions.

Your pod needs some way of making sure that everyone is working toward the same goal at all times. In other words,
your pod needs to maintain “alignment”. One straightforward way to do this is to ask each of your teammates once a
week, “how does your work get us closer to validating the hypothesis?”

Alignment and agreement are two different things. They are often used interchangeably, which is not quite right.
Agreement is when everyone thinks they’re saying the same thing. Alignment is when you know you are. When you ask
someone to repeat back an idea to you, do they describe what you think you said? Agreement focuses on the high level,
but alignment is about the details -- it takes time. You know you have alignment when you don’t need to collaborate on
every choice. Everyone uses the same hueristics to make the right decision every time, independently of each other.

Don’t wait for a leader to start building alignment. Check your own understanding of the plan and hueristics, and
challenge your podmates to do the same.

Deciding What to Work On
------------------------

Your pod’s hypothesis is far-reaching, open-ended, and not about a specific project or piece of technology. How do you
as a group go from hypothesis to shared iteration goal to individual iteration deliverables? There are some additional
questions that can help clarify this. “Will the solution we’re considering meet users’ needs?” can be answered by
implementing “tracer bullet” features. “Will the solution we’re considering be technically feasible?” can be answered
with a prototype.

Tracer Bullets
--------------

A tracer bullet project optimizes the time spent between starting work and getting feedback on the work from real
users. This interview explains the concept well:

*
Bill Venners: In your book, The Pragmatic Programmer, you suggest that programmers fire "tracer bullets." What are
tracer bullets? And what am I trading off by using tracer bullets versus "specifying the system to death," as you put
it in the book.

Dave Thomas: The idea of tracer bullets comes obviously from gunnery artillery. In the heavy artillery days, you would
take your gun position, your target position, the wind, temperature, elevation, and other factors, and feed that into
a firing table. You would get a solution that said to aim your gun at this angle and elevation, and fire. And you'd
fire your gun and hope that your shell landed somewhere close to your target. An alternative to that approach is to use
tracer bullets. If your target is moving, or if you don't know all the factors, you use tracer bullets—little
phosphorous rounds intermixed with real rounds in your gun. As you fire, you can actually see the tracer bullets.
And where they are landing is where the actual bullets are landing. If you're not quite on target—because you can see
if you're not on target—you can adjust your position.

Andy Hunt: Dynamically, in real time, under real conditions.

Dave Thomas: The software analog to firing heavy artillery by calculating everything up front is saying, "I'm going to
specify everything up front, feed that to the coders, and hope what comes out the other end is close to my target."
Instead, the tracer bullet analogy says, "Let's try and produce something really early on that we can actually give to
the user to see how close we will be to the target. As time goes on, we can adjust our aim slightly by seeing where we
are in relation to our user's target." You're looking at small iterations, skeleton code, which is non-functional,
but enough of an application to show people how it's going to hang together.Basically, it all comes down to feedback.
The more quickly you can get feedback, the less change you need to get back on target.
*

Think deeply and brainstorm with your podmates about the hypothesis, and find a “tracer bullet” project that will give
you specific, actionable feedback on the hypothesis within a single iteration. Don’t optimize for making your project
production-ready - optimize for fast feedback from real users.

Prototypes
----------

A prototype aims to explore specific technical aspects of the final product, and is made to be thrown away. It can
tell you whether a given algorithm will be performant enough, or whether the framework you’re considering will be hard
to use in practice.

A prototype doesn’t help your pod learn more about what the user wants from your product. Be careful when planning
iterations with your pod that you don’t reach for prototypes when a tracer bullet would be more appropriate.

Tracer bullets are for user exploration, and prototypes are for technical exploration.

Low-Hanging Fruit
-----------------

Your pod has a problem to solve, but it’s probably not solvable by a single project. It should definitely not be solved
by a single moon-shot project. Iterative development refers to how we solve problems, not just how we implement
projects. Can your problem get closer to being solved with a small feature now and a bigger one later? What about a
lot of small changes that solve it when combined? How do you really eat that elephant? Build the quick wins that
delight customers now, rather than something that might make them happy in 18 months.

Agile and Waterfall
-------------------

Your pod needs some sort of structure around its work cadence, and it’s up to you to decide what that will look like.
Being at this company, you’re probably not excited about adopting the complete “agile” cargo cult of standup meetings
and story points. You also have heard that it’s a good idea to avoid “waterfall” development, in which you plan
everything up front before writing a single line of code and then rigidly stick to the plan.

Your pod can organize its work however you like, but be deliberate about it. Have a conversation deciding how you’ll
come up with new ideas, divide up pieces of projects, and keep each other abreast of your progress. If you don’t see
this conversation happening, start it yourself.

As a member of a pod, you’re responsible for staying focused on how you can validate the hypothesis by shipping value
to customers with the minimum amount of work possible. Don’t wait for someone to tell you what to do - start that
conversation early, and bring your ideas. Find the “low-hanging fruit”, those projects that maximize feedback while
minimizing effort. Bias your project strategy toward shipping, toward getting a product in a user’s hands fast.
