How we communicate
==================

Since we do not work in a physical office the communication platforms we use are our office. We need to be especially
mindful about how we communicate.

Slack
-----

Slack is our primary means of communication. We use it for a mixture of synchronous and asynchronous communication.
We try to limit DMs to make sure information reaches the right audience. We use status updates to reflect when we will
be out of the office afk and when we are doing deep work deep work and will be less responsive.

Be conscious of how Slack can alert you, and minimize its potential to ditract you from focus. A common way to do this
is to mute all notifications aside from the “dock badge” indicator – that means no sounds, no fly-in messages, no phone
buzzes. Take ownership of your focus!

We generally expect team members to respond to Slack messages on the same business day that they’re sent, unless
they’re AFK.

Internal Blog
-------------

You can think of the blog as a less ephemeral version of Slack. The blog is a great place for posting long form status
updates, communicating across teams, and documenting decisions and the decision making process.

Github
------

We use github for issue tracking and our product backlog.

Our repo has its own issue tracker that contains the long list of potential improvements we could make to the data
system. Feel free to add tickets to this list at your leisure. The “good first issue” tag denotes tickets that are a
good way to get more familiar with the system without taking on too much complexity. If you’re ever short on
things to do, look for tickets there.

Make sure that when you’re @-mentioned in a GitHub comment on the repo, you get emailed about it. Responding to GitHub
mentions in a reasonable amount of time is an important part of how we communicate.

Face-to-face
------------

This is our highest bandwidth and least async mode of communication. There are costs involved in getting a group of
people together in the same meeting at the same time. It’s important to have an agenda ahead of time if we are getting
multiple people together so we make good use of everyone’s time.

Despite the costs, face-to-face time is still very important. It helps us build connections with one another. It can
also help reduce the latency of the back and forth that occurs when working through some complex problems.

The group meets once a week. We often use this time to discuss experiments we can run to improve how we work, share
things about the system that we’ve learned recently, or learn new things together. All topics are welcome!

You will also have regular 1:1s with your manager. We will figure out cadence that works for you. We can start off
with a higher frequency and adjust as you feel more comfortable here. The goal of these is not a status check-in,
which we should do asynchronously. The goal is to make sure that you are unblocked, that any questions you have are
answered, and to check in on your goals for professional growth.s
